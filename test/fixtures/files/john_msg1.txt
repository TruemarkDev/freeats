Came across your Linkedin profile and noticed your experience in Unity,
so I'd really like to tell you about an interesting project, relocating to Finland.

2015. The company's mission is to create cool mobile games that stimulate the user to learn.
users to learn. The team consists of real professionals and veterans
GameDev from companies such as XYZ Widget Company, Contoso, Fabrikam, Wingtip Toys, Woodgrove Bank,
Litware and Wonka Industries. The guys believe in changing the world by creating completely different games.

Right now, they're launching two new projects, one of which they're planning on
to release in August, so they're looking for a strong Unity3D developer who can
who can not only be responsible for the backend, but also be able to take over the development
team. This is a cool opportunity to be involved in meaningful projects from the ground up, be
to be responsible for your own "brainchild", to work with true
professionals of the world game industry. It's worth noting that the company just
closed a $5M round, and among their investors are not only Finnish companies, but also Silicon Valley companies,
so it's time to join the team and grab the option.
What do you think? I will be glad to get any feedback, I will be happy to share all the
